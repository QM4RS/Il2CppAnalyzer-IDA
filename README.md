# Il2CppAnalyzer-IDA

**Il2CppAnalyzer-IDA** is a Python script designed for **IDA Pro**, aiming to streamline the analysis and renaming of methods extracted from Il2Cpp binaries using a `dump.cs` file. This tool automates the process of setting method names, offsets, and argument types within IDA, making reverse engineering Il2Cpp-based applications more efficient.

## Features
- Parse and extract method names, classes, and offsets from the `dump.cs` file.
- Automatically rename methods in IDA to `ClassName::MethodName` format.
- Adds comments with argument types and other useful information to methods in IDA.
- Designed specifically for **Il2Cpp** reverse engineering with **IDA Pro**.

## How to Use
1. Use **frida-Il2Cpp-bridge** to generate the `dump.cs` file by running the following command within your Frida session:
   ```js
   Il2Cpp.dump()
   ```
   You can find **frida-Il2Cpp-bridge** and more details about it on its GitHub repository: [frida-Il2Cpp-bridge](https://github.com/vfsfitvnm/frida-il2cpp-bridge/).

2. Clone this repository and load the Python script in IDA Pro.

3. When prompted, select the `dump.cs` file generated by **frida-Il2Cpp-bridge**.

4. The script will automatically parse the file and apply the appropriate renaming and comments to the methods in IDA.

## Credits
This project relies heavily on the structure provided by **frida-Il2Cpp-bridge** for generating the `dump.cs` file. Special thanks to [vfsfitvnm](https://github.com/vfsfitvnm) for developing such a powerful tool.

## Requirements
- **IDA Pro** (version 7.x or later)
- **frida-Il2Cpp-bridge** for generating the `dump.cs` file: [GitHub](https://github.com/vfsfitvnm/frida-il2cpp-bridge/)
